The opening day of theG-8 International Conference on Open Data for Agriculturewas action-packed and inspiring. From the moment the doors opened at 7:30 am, the air was punctuated with the sound of languages from across the globe. Scientists, policy makers, and leaders from the non-profit and development community all shared a day of discovery and connection around the unlimited opportunity in open data for agriculture. Secretary Vilsack kicked off the proceedings with a speech that focused the day. â€œData is quickly becoming one of the most important commodities in agriculture,â€ he told the attendees, and encouraged the sharing of data to magnify its power. He also compared the digital revolution fueled by open data to the industrial revolution, in that data sharing has the same potential to accelerate development of new tools that will bolster the productivity of farmers around the world. As head of the U.S. delegation, he announced the launch of the federal governmentâ€™s contribution to these efforts: the Food, Agriculture and Rural data community, which offers a catalog of over 300 data sets as well as numerous apps, tools and statistical products. The community can be found on www.data.gov . The community will provide a one-stop shop where the public can come to access all the available data relevant to agriculture and have come from federal research and investments. The community was launched in hopes that farmers, researchers, data analysts, businesses and governments will use it to locate, download and utilize food, agriculture and rural data to address serious social, economic and environmental concerns. The Secretary was followed by Bill Gates, who addressed the conference via a short video presentation. Gates emphasized the importance of open data to entrepreneurship and innovation. Other speakers included U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park and Vice President of the World Bank Dr. Rachel Kyte. Then the day took off with â€œlightning presentationsâ€ of apps already created using open data, and already working for farmers, scientists and policymakers. Other announcements made by dayâ€™s end from our G-8 partners and others include a commitment from the African Orphan Crop consortium to share genetic sequences of neglected crops important to food security in Africa, and new data releases from the International Food Policy Research Institute, and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture with the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research.

One of the goals behind the creation of the Digital Coast was to unify groups that might not otherwise work together. This partnership network is building not only a website, but also a strong collaboration of coastal professionals intent on addressing coastal resource management needs. Website content is provided by numerous organizations, but all must meet the siteâ€™s quality and applicability standards. How it works: The strength of the Digital Coast lies in its focus on the broad coastal resource management community. The Digital Coast Partnership is continuously working to grow the Digital Coast by defining, prioritizing, and obtaining relevant website content. Application: The Digital Coast provides relevant data and tools necessary to assess coastal management issues, such as coastal inundation, offshore renewable energy planning, coastal wetlands conservation, and sea level rise adaptation. Sponsor: PlaceMatters URL: http://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/data-maps-tools Summary: Human activities on land and in the ocean are changing coastal and marine ecosystems and threatening their ability to provide important benefits to society, such as healthy and abundant seafood, clean beaches, and protection from storms and flooding. Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) is an innovative management approach to address these challenges. It considers the whole ecosystem, including humans and the environment, rather than managing one issue or resource in isolation. The EBM Tools Network is an alliance of EBM tool users, providers, and researchers to promote the use and development of tools for EBM in coastal and marine environments and the terrestrial environments that affect them. The EBM Tools Database provides the most comprehensive source of information about tools and other resources for EBM. How it works: Users can search or browse the database to find tools for their coastal and marine management and conservation projects, case studies of projects that have used tools, potential collaborators, and other resources. They can also contribute information about their own tools, projects, and expertise. Use is completely free. Application: EBM tools are software or other highly documented methods that can help implement EBM by providing models of ecosystems or key ecosystem processes; generating scenarios illustrating the consequences of different management decisions on natural resources and the economy; and facilitating stakeholder involvement in planning processes.

Sponsor: NOAA URL: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/inundation/ Summary: Coastal storms and other meteorological phenomenon can have a significant impact on how high water levels rise and how often. The inundation analysis program is extremely beneficial in determining the frequency (or the occurrence of high waters for different elevations above a specified threshold) and duration (or the amount of time that the specified location is inundated by water) of observed high waters (tides). How it works: The data output of this tool provides summary statistics, which includes the number of occurrences of inundation above the threshold (events) and length of duration of inundation of each events above the threshold elevation for a specified time period. In addition to summary statistics, graphical outputs are provided using three plots. Application: Statistical output from these analyses can be useful in planning marsh restoration activities. Additionally, the analyses have broader applications for the coastal engineering and mapping community, such as, ecosystem management and regional climate change. Since these statistical outputs are station specific, use for evaluating surrounding areas may be limited.

Sponsor: NOAA URL: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html Summary: The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services has been measuring sea level for over 150 years, with tide stations of the National Water Level Observation Network operating on all U.S. coasts. Changes in Mean Sea Level (MSL), either a sea level rise or sea level fall, have been computed at 128 long-term water level stations using a minimum span of 30 years of observations at each location. These measurements have been averaged by month to remove the effect of higher frequency phenomena (e.g. storm surge) in order to compute an accurate linear sea level trend. The trend analysis has also been extended to 240 global tide stations using data from thePermanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). How it works: Use map viewer to explore individual tide gages. Arrows represent the direction and magitude of sea level change. Application: The mean sea level (MSL) trends measured by tide gauges that are presented on this web site are local relative MSL trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with restpect to a local fixed reference level on land; therefore, if there is some long-term vertical land motion occurring at that location, the relative MSL trend measured there is a combination of the global sea level rate and the local vertical land motion.

Climate Change: Federal Efforts Under Way to Assess Water Infrastructure Vulnerabilities and Address Adaptation Challenges : This report examines (1) actions taken by the Corps and Reclamation since 2009 to assess and respond to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure and (2) challenges, if any, faced by the Corps and Reclamation in assessing and responding to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure, and the steps the agencies are taking to address them. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) analyzed the agenciesâ€™ climate change adaptation guidance and planning documents and interviewed agency officials and other key stakeholders, including water users, environmental groups, and researchers. Climate and Energy-Water-Land System Interactions : This report provides a framework to characterize and understand the important elements of climate and energy-water-land (EWL) system interactions. It identifies many of the important issues, discusses our understanding of those issues, and identifies the research needs to address the priority scientific challenges and gaps in our understanding. Much of the discussion is organized around two discrete case studies with the broad themes of (1) extreme events and (2) regional differences. These case studies help demonstrate unique ways in which energy-water-land interactions can occur and be influenced by climate. In addition, a series of illustrations portray representative decision-making considerations relevant to climate-EWL interfaces. Comparing the Impacts of the 2005 and 2008 Hurricanes on U.S. Energy Infrastructure : This report compares the impact of the major hurricanes of 2005 and 2008 on U.S. energy systems, including those that produce, process and transport oil, natural gas, and electricity. The magnitude and duration of hurricane-induced production and supply disruptions are compared, as well as the extent of damage to energy infrastructure.

As with all homeland security activities, these actions seek to ensure security, resilience, and customs and exchange with the world across all core mission areas. Effect of Sea Level Rise on Energy Infrastructure in Four Major Metropolitan Areas : The study overlays information about potential Sea Level Risk (SLR) exposure to energy infrastructure locations around 4 major U.S. cities, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. To assess possible exposure to SLR, the study uses recent government data and modeling results, including: (1) Global SLR scenarios that are based on alternative assumptions about the effects of climate change on sea levels, from the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA); (2) Analyses of the geographic extent of inundation from higher sea levels, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center (CSC); and (3) Locations of energy assets identified by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) as part of ongoing studies of energy infrastructure. Effects of Climate Change on Federal Hydropower : This report contains data from a new, nationwide study of the observed and projected impacts of global climate change on federal hydropower generation using climate modeling as well as hydrological and hydro power generation data. Energy's Water Demand: Trends, Vulnerabilities, and Management : The report first lays out the trends shaping energyâ€™s water use; second, it discusses energyâ€™s vulnerability to water constraints; and third, it discusses projections of energyâ€™s water use. It then explores three regional examples of energyâ€™s water use: shale gas in Texas, solar energy in the Southwest, and biofuels in the High Plains. Finally, it discusses policy options and legislative approaches for managing energyâ€™s water use. Several appendices provide more detailed information on specific technologies, fuels, and trends. The report does not discuss in detail the energy sectorâ€™s water quality impacts, although they represent their own challenges, as shown by concerns over the water quality effects of hydraulic fracturing, mountaintop mining, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Energy use by the water sector also is not discussed in this report, although water conservation is one of many available means for reducing energy demand.

Estimated Use of Water in the United States in 2005: U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1344 : This report, â€œEstimated use of water in the United States in 2005,â€ is the twelfth in a series of reports that have been compiled and published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) every 5 years since 1950. These reports include estimates of water withdrawals by State, source of water, and category of use. Data from 2005 and earlier years can be used to indicate changes in water use over time, among different geographic areas, and from different sources. Water-use information complements the study of surface-water and groundwater availability, and is essential to understanding how future water demands will be met while maintaining adequate water quality and quantities for human and ecosystem needs. This report presents water-use estimates by source and by State for eight categories of water use for 2005. Sources include surface water and groundwater, both fresh and saline. Categories include public supply, domestic, irrigation, livestock, aquaculture, industrial, mining, and thermoelectric power. All withdrawals for the public-supply, domestic, irrigation, and livestock categories are shown as freshwater, although in some areas water is treated to reduce salinity for these uses. Both fresh and saline withdrawals are shown for industrial, mining, and thermoelectric-power generation uses. Geographic areas include 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are hereafter referred to as â€œStatesâ€ for brevity.

This effort entailed development of a database of power plants and cooling water intake locations and depths for those plants that use surface water as a source of cooling water. Development of the database and its general characteristics are described in Chapter 2 of this report. Examination of the database gives an indication of how low water levels can drop before cooling water intakes cease to function. Water level drops are evaluated against a number of different power plant characteristics, such as the nature of the water source (river vs. lake or reservoir) and type of plant (nuclear vs. fossil fuel). Impact of Future Climate Variability on ERCOT Thermoelectric Power Generation : This report summarizes a study to determine the medium-term (through the year 2030) impacts of future climate and drought scenarios on electricity generation by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)."
24_3,https://data.gov/climate/energy-infrastructure/energy-infrastructure-featured-content/,Energy Infrastructure Featured Content - Data.gov,"Because water in reservoirs is used to cool many steam cycle-based power plants, significantly low water levels can reduce the ability to cool power plants. This reduced cooling ability can come from physical supply limitations or environmental constraints (power plant effluent temperatures exceeding permitted limits). The approach projects future climate and water demands to determine stream flows, water storage in reservoirs, and power plant effluent temperatures. The results for historical and future water availability, demand, its cost, reservoir storage, and stream flow are reported for U.S. Geological Survey 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC8) water basins. The water and climate data are compared to power plant characteristics and past performance data to infer the likelihood that future summer power generation could be curtailed at a power plant. Beyond impacts on the existing fleet of power plants, this study also considers siting of future power plants to avoid regions of limited water availability. Oil and Gas Produced Water Management and Beneficial Use in the Western United States : Produced water from oil and gas operations is currently handled as a waste product. The quality of produced water varies significantly based on the geochemistry of the producing formation, the type of hydrocarbon produced, and the characteristics of the producing well. If produced water meets appropriate water quality criteria, it may be used beneficially for purposes such as irrigation, livestock watering, aquifer storage, streamflow augmentation, and municipal and industrial uses. Treatment may be required to improve the quality of produced water so that it can be put to beneficial use. Risk Assessment of Climate Systems for National Security : Climate change, through drought, flooding, storms, heat waves, and melting Arctic ice, affects the production and flow of resources within and among geographical regions. The interactions among governments, populations, and sectors of the economy require integrated assessment based on risk, through uncertainty quantification (UQ). This project evaluated the capabilities with Sandia National Laboratories to perform such integrated analyses, as they relate to (inter)national security. The combining of the UQ results from climate models with hydrological and economic/infrastructure impact modeling appears to offer the best capability for national security risk assessments. Synthesis and Assessment Product (SAP) 4.5: Effects of Climate Change on Energy Production and Use in the United States : This report summarizes what is currently known about effects of climate change on energy production and use in the United States. The report concludes that, based on what was known in 2008, there are reasons to pay close attention to possible climate change impacts on energy production and use and to consider ways to adapt to possible adverse impacts and take advantage of possible positive impacts. The Energy Water Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities : The report frames the integrated challenge and opportunity space around the water-energy nexus for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its partners. It further explains and strengthens the logical structure underpinning DOEâ€™s long-standing technology and modeling research and development (R&D) efforts, and lays the foundation for future efforts."

The Nexus of Biofuels, Climate Change, and Human Health: Workshop Summary : Liquid fuels are a major part of modern life. They supply energy for ground, water, and air transportation as well as power for industrial and farming machinery. But fossil fuels â€"" the dominant liquid fuel in use for well over a century â€"" have many disadvantages. The use of fossil fuels has obvious health downsides, such as emissions of pollutants that are directly harmful to health. The burning of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming, itself a long-term threat to human health. There have also been health concerns related to insecurity of liquid fuel supplies and the potential of international conflicts being caused by fuel scarcity. Furthermore, there are concerns that the worldâ€™s large but still limited supply of fossil fuels could be strained by the increasing demand that results from societies around the world achieving greater prosperity. In the face of these concerns, new policies have been created that encourage the development of renewable sources of energy in general and biofuels in particular. U.S. Energy Sector Vulnerabilities to Climate Change and Extreme Weather : Report containing information on climate (temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.) coupled with data on U.S. energy system infrastructures, including the locations of fossil and renewable energy sources, energy conversion facilities, and transmission and distribution pathways. Water Implications of Biofuels Production in the United States : National interests in greater energy independence, concurrent with favorable market forces, have driven increased production of corn-based ethanol in the United States and research into the next generation of biofuels. The trend is changing the national agricultural landscape and has raised concerns about potential impacts on the nationâ€™s water resources. To help illuminate these issues, the National Research Council held a colloquium on July 12, 2007 in Washington, D.C. Water Implications of Biofuels Production in the United States, based in part on discussions at the colloquium, concludes that if projected future increases in use of corn for ethanol production do occur, the increase in harm to water quality could be considerable from the increases in fertilizer use, pesticide use, and soil erosion associated with growing crops such as corn. Water supply problems could also develop, both from the water needed to grow biofuels crops and water used at ethanol processing plants, especially in regions where water supplies are already overdrawn. The production of â€œcellulosic ethanol,â€ derived from fibrous material such as wheat straw, native grasses, and forest trimmings is expected to have less water quality impact but cannot yet be produced on a commercial scale. To move toward a goal of reducing water impacts of biofuels, a policy bridge will likely be needed to encourage growth of new technologies, best agricultural practices, and the development of traditional and cellulosic crops that require less water and fertilizer and are optimized for fuel production."

The body of scientific literature on climate change and water resources is vast and growing. The focus of this report is primarily on information that is well-documented, peer-reviewed, and useful to assess impacts of climate change on freshwater resources, including key vulnerabilities, and the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies. The report is organized by six key issues: (1) Precipitation patterns and intensity; (2) Surface water, including streamflow, snowmelt, and floods; (3) Groundwater, including soil moisture; (4) Water Quality; (5) Water Resources Management Implications, and (6) Adaptation. Information presented herein primarily is based on observations and projections of change. Water Reuse: Potential for Expanding the Nationâ€™s Water Supply Through Reuse of Municipal Wastewater : Expanding water reuseâ€""the use of treated wastewater for beneficial purposes including irrigation, industrial uses, and drinking water augmentationâ€""could significantly increase the nationâ€™s total available water resources. Water Reuse presents a portfolio of treatment options available to mitigate water quality issues in reclaimed water along with new analysis suggesting that the risk of exposure to certain microbial and chemical contaminants from drinking reclaimed water does not appear to be any higher than the risk experienced in at least some current drinking water treatment systems, and may be orders of magnitude lower. This report recommends adjustments to the federal regulatory framework that could enhance public health protection for both planned and unplanned (or de facto) reuse and increase public confidence in water reuse. Water Vulnerabilities for Existing Coal-Fired Power Plants : This study identified coal-fired power plants that are considered vulnerable to water demand and supply issues by using a geographic information system (GIS) that facilitated the analysis of plant-specific data for more than 500 plants in the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETLâ€™s) Coal Power Plant Database (CPPDB) (NETL 2007a) simultaneously with 18 indicators of water demand and supply. Two types of demand indicators were evaluated. The first type consisted of geographical areas where specific conditions can generate demand vulnerabilities. These conditions include high projected future water consumption by thermoelectric power plants, high projected future water consumption by all users, high rates of water withdrawal per square mile (mi2), high projected population increases, and areas projected to be in a water crisis or conflict by 2025. The second type of demand indicator was plant specific. These indicators were developed for each plant and include annual water consumption and withdrawal rates and intensities, net annual power generation, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The supply indicators, which are also area based, include areas with low precipitation, high temperatures, low streamflow, and drought.

There are a number of important use considerations for the data provided here. Please click here for guidance notes to read before making use of these data. What types of data are available? The links below provide access to a growing body of data, generated by climate models, relevant to understanding potential future climate change. This includes raw climate model output, as well as model output that has been processed by â€œbias correctionâ€ (removal of some known errors) and/or â€œdownscalingâ€ (addition of finer spatial detail). We refer to these types of information collectively as â€œclimate simulation results.â€ These data have been produced using the leading climate research models, whose outputs have informed important scientific assessments of climate change and its impacts, such as the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports and the National Climate Assessment . They have been collected into several archives and portals for increased ease of access to outputs from multiple models and types of simulations. In addition, scenarios.globalchange.gov provides scenarios: quantitative and narrative descriptions of plausible future conditions that provide assumptions for analyses of potential impacts and responses to climate change. Scenarios are ways to help understand what future conditions might be, with each scenario an example of what might happen under different assumptions. Scenarios generally blend both model output and other information, such as observed trends. They are not predictions or forecasts, and no probabilities are associated with them. Instead, they provide a range of future conditions to bound uncertainty. The scenarios accessed through scenarios.globalchange.gov include climate change, sea level change, and land use and population change. They are based on peer-reviewed, published sources and were used in the development of the National Climate Assessment, which provides scientific findings about climate change and its impacts on U.S. regions and key socioeconomic sectors.

43_1,https://data.gov/climate/portals/,Climate Model Projections - Data.gov,"Sponsor: Multiple Fed/Univ/NGO URL: https://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/ Summary: This archive contains fine spatial resolution translations of climate projections over the contiguous United States (U.S.) developed using two downscaling techniques (monthly BCSD Figure 1, and daily BCCA Figure 2), and hydrologic projections over the western U.S. (roughly the western U.S. Figure 3) corresponding to the monthly BCSD climate projections. Archive content is based on global climate projections from the World Climate Research Programmeâ€™s (WCRPâ€™s) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset referenced in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, and the phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model dataset that informed much of the IPCC Fifth Assessment. The downscaled data archive also includes GCM results that have been interpolated to a common, 1 deg. (latitiude) by 1 deg. (longitude) horizontal grid (but not downscaled), as well as GCM results that have been interpolated to the 1Ã—1 degree grid and â€œbias corrected,â€ but not downscaled. Sponsor: NASA/USGS URL: https://www2.usgs.gov/climate_landuse/clu_rd/nccv/viewer.asp Summary: To derive higher resolution data for regional climate change assessments, NASA applied a statistical technique to downscale maximum and minimum air temperature and precipitation from 33 of the CMIP5 climate models to a very fine, 800-m grid over the continental United States (CONUS). The full NEX-DCP30 dataset covers the historical period (1950-2005) and 21st century (2006-2099) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios developed for AR5. The USGS National Climate Change Viewer (NCCV) includes the historical and future climate projections from 30 of the CMIP5 models, downscaled to an 800-m grid over the continental United States under the NASA NEX-DCP30 project, for two of the RCP emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). USGS has also used the downscaled temperature and precipitation data from these 30 CMIP5 models as input to a simple water-balance model to simulate changes in the surface water balance (snow water equivalent, runoff, soil water storage and evaporative deficit) over the historical and future time periods on the 800-m CONUS grid. Combining the climate data with the water balance data in the NCCV provides further insights into the potential for climate-driven change in water resources. The NCCV shows averages of the climate and water balance data over four climatology periods: 1950-2005, 2025-2049, 2050-2074, and 2075-2099. The viewer provides a number of useful tools for characterizing climate change including maps, climographs (plots of monthly averages), histograms that show the distribution or spread of the model simulations, monthly time series spanning 1950-2099, and tables that summarize changes in the quantiles (median and extremes) of the variables. The application also provides access to comprehensive, summary reports in PDF format and CSV files of the temperature and precipitation data for each geographic area. Sponsor: USGS/Oregon State Univ.

Before using scenarios or climate simulation results, it is important to make sure you have formulated specific questions you want to address, and to investigate whether you can do that using the results of existing analyses, rather than performing your own. The more specific the question(s) you can formulate, the easier it will be to decide whether you need to use and analyze climate model data sets, and if so which ones. This is important, because there is no â€œbestâ€ data set or â€œbestâ€ climate model; which ones you should use will depend on what question(s) you are trying to address, in what geographical region(s), etc. If you decide that you do need to use and analyze climate simulation results, you should keep several points in mind as you proceed: Each data set of climate simulation results generally contains only selected types of information, which limits the range of questions it can be applied to. For example, many datasets of downscaled climate projections include information about temperature and precipitation only; these cannot be used to address questions involving storm surge or extreme winds, for example. Also, climate data sets may contain only monthly-averaged quantities (e.g. temperature); these may not be useful for many purposes. Climate simulations generally make no attempt to predict the timing of natural climate variability; hence for example these datasets may contain useful information about conditions during El Nino years, but they canâ€™t tell you when these years will occur. Many users are interested in information about extreme weather of some sort (heat, precipitation, etc.) These can be difficult to simulate realistically; extreme precipitation is particularly tricky. Simulations of future climate are all based upon assumptions about future greenhouse gas concentrations and other factors that influence climate; this is one reason why these simulations are referred to as â€œprojectionsâ€ rather than â€œpredictions.â€ In addition, there are numerous uncertainties in the climate models themselves, due to the challenge of numerically simulating all relevant aspects of the climate system over long timescales of decades to centuries. Therefore, even given the same assumptions about future greenhouse gases, different models will often produce different results, particularly at finer spatial scales and for extremes. (Note that some of these differences also result from random weather variations, and therefore do not represent true differences among model responses to greenhouse gas increases, but nevertheless can lead to different simulation results.) For this reason, it is considered good practice to use output from multiple models to explore a range of scientifically plausible futures â€"" to account for an envelope of future climate risk, rather than a single future pathway."

However, when we travel to far-flung places, we may find ourselves packing food from home because we donâ€™t know what may be available when we arrive. We have a global, comprehensive, open data set that enables weather forecasting, but not something similar for food and agriculture? In his first public remarks as head of USDA, Secretary Sonny Perdue noted that â€œâ€¦we want to make decisions based on facts and evidence,â€ â€œwe want to be data-driven,â€ and â€œI need good data, I need good sound science to make decisions onâ€¦â€ USDA recognizes that farmers, ranchers, and consumers alike â€"" use data daily, from deciding when to plant, harvest or sell their crops, when to turn out cattle to pasture, or where to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. This is why it is important that data be made available, open and accessible, to facilitate the best-informed decisions. Around the world, a movement called the â€œopen data revolutionâ€ is under way to make data available for public use. This movement is expected to generate new insights, drive better decision-making, and enable governments, civil society, and the private sector to better target interventions and programs. All of this is why the U.S. Government, led by USDA, was a founding partner of the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) initiative and why it continues to support the advancement of open data for agriculture and nutrition around the world. Now with over 500 partners, GODAN continues to support the sharing of available, accessible, and usable open data for agriculture and nutrition to help ensure global food security. If weâ€™re going to feed over 9 billion people by 2050, we need open data policies to make decisions based on facts and evidence.
