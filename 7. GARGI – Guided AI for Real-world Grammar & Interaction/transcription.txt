One scientific discovery that fascinates me is a development of artificial intelligence. Scientists have created machines that can learn, think and solve problems like human. Artificial intelligence is now using healthcare, education, transportation to make work faster and more accurate. This discovery excites me because it has a power to improve our daily lives. For example, AI Health Dr. Detect Disease is early and supports students with professionalising learning. I also open new opportunities for innovation and creativity. This discovery makes me hopeful about the future and inspire me to learn more about science and technology. And the reason that I am doing my MSc in artificial intelligence and I am seeing my career as an AI just because of this technology improvement. And I really, really appreciate that the science discovery has created so far for the artificial intelligence. And in near future we are going to develop more and more information.
