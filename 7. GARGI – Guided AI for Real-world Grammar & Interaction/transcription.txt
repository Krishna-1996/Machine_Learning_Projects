Recently, I read a news report about server floods effect many parts of a country due to heavy rainfall. Thousands of people lost their homes, schools were closed and daily life came to the halt. Many families were focused to leave their houses with only a few belongings. This news effect me deeply because it shows how quickly life can change due to natural disasters. It also made me realize the importance of helping other in time of crisis. I felt inspired by the rescue team and volunteers who worked day and night to save lives and provide relief. This story remind me to be a grateful of what I have and to always stand together as a community during difficult times. Thank you so much and have a really great day.
