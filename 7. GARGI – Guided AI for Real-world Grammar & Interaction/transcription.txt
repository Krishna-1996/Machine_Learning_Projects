My favorite family recipe is my grandmother's chocolate chip cookies. Baking them with her was always special. We mix the dow, fold in chocolate chips and smell the warm aroma filling the kitchen. The cookies are soft, sweet and comforting. But what I love most is that the cherry family memories, even bite reminds me of home, love and the joy of sharing simple moment with the life. That's why I still at the age of 50.
