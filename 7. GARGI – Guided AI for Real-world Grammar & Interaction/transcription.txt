Wheels in my opinion is the best option which describe the historical event that actually change the shape of the world because in the beginning when there is a stone age there was wheel which I had seen made up of stone with square shape then it goes with some more trapezoan something different and then finally a circular one. If you notice that this circular wheel is not just actually used in vehicles but also in motors in every equipment where we have to run one thing from different things like gears is there. So this invention is not just the the helping investment in in invention but also a very important invention so far in the history because wheels provide us the latest technical equipment.
