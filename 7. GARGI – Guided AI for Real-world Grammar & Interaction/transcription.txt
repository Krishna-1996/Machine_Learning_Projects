In one of my past friendships, I learned that trust and communication are very important. Misunderstanding can easily affect any relationship and being honest with each other can prevent conflicts. This experience taught me to the more patients and understanding with people. At the same time, I realized that no all relations in life came from relationship. School project team work in sports and family interaction also teach important skills and responsibilities like time management and preservation. These experience help shape who we are even if they are not directly about friendship or relationship. Overall, I think every experience whether from the relationship or elsewhere teaches something valuable that helps us growth as individual. And as I already understand that being a part of a other life, you should have to maintain the dignity with each other.
