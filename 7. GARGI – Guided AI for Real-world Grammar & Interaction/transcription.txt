Well, Apple is a fruit and if we go through with the random forest classification, the thing is going to be intact. And as I got through with the CNN also, convolutional neural network and this convolutional neural network is actually beyond what I was expecting and because there is a time series in my data set. So, that is why I use RLNN which is recurring neural neural network and that is how the thing is going beyond the expectation from the stake hole.
