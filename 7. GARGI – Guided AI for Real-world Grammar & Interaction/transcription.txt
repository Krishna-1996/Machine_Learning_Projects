I had seen multiple challenges while balancing the school and my hobbies and my hobbies to play volleyball and in my school there is very less chance to play volleyball because we don't have that much of ground and talking about the school studies like homework, classwork and other stuff is also like a burden at that time. But eventually the most important part is played by the teachers, my fellow mates as well I when the principal sir is being there. So they help every student like there is a balance between the studies as well as the curricular activities especially my hobbies. So there are some two now in my school and principal sir allow me to skip some classes where I am good at one specifically the mathematics and he allow me to play volleyball and improve my hobby and skill and I play for the school inter school volleyball.
