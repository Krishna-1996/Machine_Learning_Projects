My favorite type of performance art is dance. So dance is more than just a moment. It is a language of emotions through rhythms, gesture and expressions. Dancers tell story that word often can't capture. I love how each performance is unique, blended music, costumes and energy to create a powerful experience for the audience. Watching a skilled dancer transform feeling into motion inspired.
