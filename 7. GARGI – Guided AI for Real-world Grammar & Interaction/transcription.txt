I am from India and the political conspiracy that is going through in our national region is basically related to the different countries and the political concept that is going through in Bangladesh or in Pakistan is like in humanity which I feel like you should not to be do these things and latest information as per the political review is that there is an terrorist attack in the Australia this is a ridiculous thing that is being happen which shows up political relevance in the conceptual basis and it is not something that is required by a human or a human can able to understand but at the end of the day the politics need to be restored with the humanity and we should have to focus more on being human rather than playing with the political agenda that you are chasing from here and there.
