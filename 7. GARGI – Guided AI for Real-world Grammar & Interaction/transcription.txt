The most sustainable solution for the plastic weight is to reduce the use of plastic. First of all we have to stop the production of a plastic so that the user, the common people can't able to buy it and we need to find an alternative. For example if you are using plastic for chairs. So rather than using plastic we can use some metallic one or wooden one or any other options we can use it. So first reduce the use of plastic, second the production of a plastic which is in my opinion would be the most impactful and the sustainable solution for the plastic waste. And if you have any plastic waste you should have to recycle it and if you cant able to recycle at least you know do not throw it anywhere into the soil or on a ground.
