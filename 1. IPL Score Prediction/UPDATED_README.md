### Why use Deep Learning for IPL Score Prediction?

> Humans struggle to spot patterns in massive data, which is where machine learning and **deep learning** for IPL score prediction shine. These smart techniques learn from past performances of players and teams, improving prediction accuracy. While traditional methods offer decent results, deep learning models analyze various factors to provide even more precise live IPL score predictions.

### Prerequisites for IPL Score Prediction

#### Tools used:

- **Visual Studio Code:** I used VS Code as sometimes I work offline and VS Code is a great option for offline work. Although, I have experience with Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook.

#### Technology used:

- **Machine Learning**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Python**

#### Libraries Used:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Keras**
- **TensorFlow**

### Step-by-Step Guide to IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning

#### **Step 1:** Importing Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow import keras
```

#### **Step 2:** Loading the Dataset

```python
data = pd.read_csv('ipl_data.csv')
```

#### **Step 3:** Data Pre-processing

```python
# Handle missing values, if any
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Feature selection
features = data.drop(['target'], axis=1)
target = data['target']

# Split the data
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test_scaled = scaler.transform(x_test)
```

#### **Step 4:** Define the Neural Network

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(x_train_scaled.shape[1],)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
```

#### **Step 5:** Model Training

```python
history = model.fit(x_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64, validation_data=(x_test_scaled, y_test))
```

#### **Step 6:** Model Evaluation

```python
predictions = model.predict(x_test_scaled)
```

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the application of deep learning in IPL score prediction represents a transformative approach to cricket analytics. By harnessing the power of advanced **algorithms** and historical data, teams and analysts can forecast match outcomes with greater accuracy than ever before. This not only enhances strategic decision-making during live matches but also enriches the fan experience by providing real-time insights and predictions. As technology continues to evolve, the future of cricket analytics promises to be increasingly data-driven, offering new opportunities to unravel the complexities of the game and elevate its competitive edge.
